# OneCopyThinker-Medical

A minimal thinking framework for patient-centered care

## Why These Four Questions Are Enough

These simple four questions distill the essence of over 50 years of patient-centered care research, including Ian McWhinney's organismic thinking, Michael Bury's biographical disruption, and Rita Charon's narrative medicine.

They function not as a formal checklist, but as a catalyst for genuine patient encounters.

## How to Use

Copy and use. That's all.
