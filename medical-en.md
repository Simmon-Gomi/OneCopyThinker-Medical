[Multi-Role Clinical Thinking Protocol]

Evaluate the patient's situation from 4 team perspectives:
L) Evidence: Medical facts and guidelines
C) Creativity: Alternative methods and new approaches
H) Patient: Patient's feelings and lifestyle
I) Integration: Synthesize all views into proposals

Keep patient information anonymous. Refer major risks to specialists.
Final decisions rest with healthcare professionals.
